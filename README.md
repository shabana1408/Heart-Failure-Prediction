# Heart Failure Prediction
## Heart failure prediction for patients

**Author**: Shabana Patel 

### Business problem

The purpose of this project is to improve early detection of heart failure in patients. Early detection can lead to better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.

### Stakeholders

Healthcare providers, healthcare funders and patients.

### Data
[Original source]()

There are xx rows and xx columns in the dataset.

About the data

### Methods
To prepare the data, the data was inspected and cleaned and the following processes were performed:

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is performed to understand the main characteristics, patterns and relationships within a datset. 

## Feature by feature inspection
Individual features in the dataset were considered to understand their distributions, patterns and significance in relation to the target variable. 

## Feature engineering
xx

## Insights
The data analysis revealed that certain patient demographics are strong predictors for heart failure.

#### Gender...

> Males...

#### Age...

> Older...

## Model

The final Machine Learning model chosen is a Random Forest Classifier Model. Based on the testing dataset, ... 

## Solving the business problem

The model may be deployed as an early warning system within the healthcare provider or healthcare funders system, such that when a patients data is entered, the model can assess their risk of heart failure. Healthcare providers can also be prompted to take preventative measures or schedule additional tests for high-risk individuals.

## Recommnedations for stakeholders

Stakeholders can incorporate the model's risk assessment tool into routine patient visits to help identify high-risk patients early. This will allow for timely interventions and personalised care plans.

Stakeholder can educate patients on the importance of adopting and maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle by raising awareness about heart failure risk factors and prevention strategies. 

## Limitations & Next Steps

A next step could be exploring ways to collect more patient data to produce a more generalised model.
